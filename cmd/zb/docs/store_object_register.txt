Adds information for objects already present in the store directory to the store
database. Information is read from stdin in the same format as
`zb store object info`. Multiple records may be concatenated together into a
single stream. Each record must start with "StorePath:". Blank lines are
ignored.

This command is intended for use by the installer to add the initial store
objects. Prefer `zb store object import` for adding objects, as the import
process won't leave partial objects in the store.
