## [Unreleased][]

Version 0.2 adds support for remote caching.
This is a foundational feature which allows zb users to reuse build results
from public caches, continuous integration servers, or even other teammates' machines.
[256 Lights](https://256lights.llc) runs a public cache for the [standard library](https://github.com/256lights/zb-stdlib),
which turns the "Hello, World!" build on a new machine
from roughly 10 minutes to XX seconds with a reasonably fast internet connection.

### Added

- `zb serve` can now be [configured](https://zb.256lights.llc/admin/configuration#confval-server.download)
  to download built artifacts from a [remote cache](https://zb.256lights.llc/binary-cache/).
  ([#39](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/39)
  and [#43](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/43))
  Thank you to [@Abdiramen](https://github.com/Abdiramen)
  for the support in getting the algorithm over the finish line.
  Remote caches can be Google Cloud Storage
  ([#258](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/258)),
  network filesystems, or any HTTP server.
- `zb serve` can also be configured to upload built artifacts to a remote cache.
  ([#165](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/165))
  HTTP remote caches must support PUT requests to be used.
  Build artifacts are compressed using [zstd][] by default,
  falling back to gzip or uncompressed if the remote cache does not support zstd.
  ([#260](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/260))
- `zb serve` now signs realizations using configured keys.
  ([#159](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/159))
- `zb build` will restrict realizations to public keys it trusts.
  A new `zb build --clean` flag allows building without using any realizations.
  ([#20](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/20))
- New [`lazy` function](https://zb.256lights.llc/lua/extensions#lazy).
  ([#83](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/83))
- New [`readFile` function](https://zb.256lights.llc/lua/extensions#readFile).
  ([#148](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/148))
  Thank you to [@winterqt](https://github.com/winterqt)!
- HTTP requests can be authenticated via a `.netrc` file.
- Various settings can now be set in a [configuration file](https://zb.256lights.llc/configuration).
  ([#162](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/162))
- `zb serve` will reject new build requests
  and exit successfully after all builds have completed
  after receiving `SIGUSR2`.
  ([#259](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/259))
- `zb build` now uses an `__outputs` metamethod to determine what derivations to build
  rather than requiring the result to be a `derivation` function result.
  Thank you to [@ocurr](https://github.com/ocurr) for the design feedback!
  ([#117](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/117))

### Changed

- `zb eval` now prints its output using Lua's `tostring` rules
  instead of its own formatting logic.
- Attempting to run multiple `zb serve` processes
  on a single store database now results in an error.
  ([#207](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/207))
  Thank you to [@Abdiramen](https://github.com/Abdiramen)!
- Small HTTP requests are now cached on disk.
  ([#140](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/140))
  This benefits `zb build` arguments of remote URLs
  as well as remote caching in `zb serve`.

### Removed

- URL arguments no longer search top-level tables with the current system string.
  This wasn't documented, but the standard library assumed its usage.

### Fixed

- `zb store object delete` is no longer flaky
  ([#135](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/135)).
- Lua operator metamethods now receive their arguments in the correct order
  when one of the operands is a constant
  ([#152](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/152)).
- `string.format` in Lua now handles infinity and NaN
  ([#78](https://github.com/256lights/zb/issues/78)).
  Thank you to [@HigherOrderLogic](https://github.com/HigherOrderLogic)!
- Improved backend disk performance by performing less `fsync` syscalls.
- Updated to Go 1.26.5.
