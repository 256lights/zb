.SH NAME

blood-elf - Get mescc with dwarfs

.SH SYNOPSIS
.na

blood-elf --file FILE [--output FILE --64]

.SH DESCRIPTION

blood-elf exists to generate ELF debug tables in M1-macro
format from M1-macro assembly files.
.br

At its core is read until you find :LABEL and then add it
to the list of things to output. It will ignore labels that
have '_' prefixing their name. eg :_foo will not get an entry.
If no output is specified, the result will be sent to Standard
Out.

.br
Fortunately the only architecture difference that you need
to concern yourself with is if your binary is going to be
64bits or 32bits (which is the default) and to pass the flag:
--64 should you need that alternate format

.SH EXAMPLES

Typically, blood-elf will be called in scripts used in bootstrapping
.br
# blood-elf -f cc.M1 -o cc-footer.M1
.br
# blood-elf --file cc.M1 --64 --output cc-footer.M1
.br

.SH COMPATIBILITY

blood-elf is compatible with all Turing complete machines;
even the ones that try to be Turing complete -1.
