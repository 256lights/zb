# Backend implementation notes

## Store Concurrency

- The backend assumes at most one backend is running per-store-directory.
- The backend generally assumes that no other process will write to the store directory.
  (However, it is a bit more defensive about testing this assumption:
  if a store object is obviously missing or corrupted, it will complain.)
- The backend assumes that if and only if a store object is present in the store directory
  will a corresponding row exist in the `objects` table.
- The `inProgress` lock for a store path is acquired before accessing any store object.
  The lock is held while importing or accessing a store object.
  During access, the lock is released once it has been determined that the object exists.
  (Code may assume that if a store object exists at this time,
  it is fully constructed because of the previous bullet.)
  During import of a store object, the lock is released once it has been written to the filesystem
  and the row has been written to the `objects` table.
