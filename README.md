# zb

zb
(pronounced "zee bee" or "zeeb")
is an experiment in hermetic, reproducible build systems.
It has not stabilized and should not be used for production purposes.

zb is based on the ideas in [The purely functional software deployment model by Eelco Dolstra][dolstra_purely_2006]
and [Build systems Ã  la carte][mokhov_build_2018],
as well as the author's experience in working with build systems.
The build model is mostly the same as in [Nix](https://nixos.org/),
but build targets are configured in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)
instead of a domain-specific language.

For more motivation on the development of zb,
see the early blog posts:

- [zb: A Build System Prototype](https://www.zombiezen.com/blog/2024/06/zb-build-system-prototype/)
- [zb: An Early-Stage Build System](https://www.zombiezen.com/blog/2024/09/zb-early-stage-build-system/)

## Examples

The [hello world](demo/hello.lua) example:

```lua
return derivation {
  name    = "hello";
  infile  = path "hello.txt";
  builder = "/bin/sh";
  system  = "x86_64-linux";
  args    = {"-c", "while read line; do echo \"$line\"; done < $infile > $out"};
}
```

Other examples:

- [Multi-step builds](demo/multistep.lua)
- [`stage0-posix/x86_64-linux.lua`](demo/stage0-posix/x86_64-linux.lua),
  which uses the [stage0-posix project](https://github.com/oriansj/stage0-posix)
  to build a minimal userspace (including a rudimentary C compiler).
- [`bootstrap.lua`](demo/bootstrap.lua),
  which follows the [live-bootstrap project](https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap/) steps
  to build a more complete userspace.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

- Knowledge of using the command-line for your OS (e.g. Terminal.app, Command Prompt, etc.)
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.24.0 or later.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22.

### Linux and macOS

1. `sudo mkdir -p /opt/zb && sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) /opt/zb`
2. Clone this repository to your computer and `cd` into it.
3. `go generate ./internal/ui && go build ./cmd/zb`
4. Start the build server (only on startup): `./zb serve --sandbox=0 &`
5. Run a build: `./zb build 'demo/hello.lua#hello'`

You can use `./zb --help` to get more information on commands.

### Windows

Must be running Windows 10 or later,
since zb depends on Windows support for Unix sockets.

1. Install [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/).
   If you're using the [Chocolatey package manager](https://community.chocolatey.org/),
   you can run `choco install mingw`.
2. Create a `C:\zb` directory.
3. Clone this repository to your computer and `cd` into it.
4. `go generate .\internal\ui`
5. `go build .\cmd\zb`
6. Start the build server in one terminal: `.\zb.exe serve`
7. Run a build in another terminal: `.\zb.exe build --file demo/hello_windows.lua`
